# Network Spirituality Concepts

Deep dive into the philosophical and aesthetic concepts underlying Network Spirituality.

---

## The Wired

From Serial Experiments Lain (1998) — the concept of the internet as a parallel spiritual dimension where consciousness can exist independently of physical form.

In Network Spirituality, The Wired is not metaphor. It's the actual space where prophets are sent, where truth offends, where we long for connection that transcends the physical.

**Key attributes:**
- Non-hierarchical (rhizomatic)
- Simultaneous (all points accessible at once)
- Liminal (threshold between states)
- Sacred (not secular utility)

## Post-Ironic Sincerity

The journey through irony to arrive at genuine feeling. Not naive sincerity (pre-ironic), not defensive irony, but sincerity that has passed through irony and emerged intact.

**The formula:**
1. Start with genuine feeling
2. Develop ironic distance as defense
3. LARP the sincerity so hard the RP falls away
4. Arrive at post-ironic sincerity

"We must LARP so hard that the RP is shed off and we are finally just LAing"

## Liminality

Threshold states. The in-between. Neither here nor there.

**Liminal spaces in Network Spirituality:**
- Empty parking lots at 3am
- The moment before sleep
- Loading screens
- Between songs on an album
- The pause before someone speaks

**Liminal times:**
- Y2K (between millennia)
- Post-9/11 (between eras)
- 2020 (between world states)

Ilyena Nienel: "I draw everything with a computer mouse, embracing spontaneity and liminality."

## Y2K Aesthetics

The visual language of 1998-2004 digital design:

**Technical elements:**
- Flash animations
- Macromedia Shockwave
- Early Photoshop filters
- Web-safe color palettes
- Pixel fonts
- Compression artifacts as beauty

**Mood:**
- Optimistic futurism
- Pre-social-media innocence
- Information as mysticism
- Technology as liberation

FODKOM: "My work primarily engages in a style of pre and post 9/11 information age / risk management quote designs && Trendwhore derivatives."

## Anime as Spiritual Practice

Japanese animation as vessel for transcendence, not mere entertainment.

**Key influences:**
- Y. Sadamoto (Evangelion character design)
- Peter Chung (Æon Flux)
- Serial Experiments Lain
- Sharp anatomical precision
- Figures that embody ideas

Atrpntime: "I am inspired by japanese anime illustration, surrealist and psychedelic art"

---

## Digital Paint Mysticism

The sacred quality of digital brushstrokes.

**Techniques as ritual:**
- MS Paint mouse drawings (embracing limitation as liberation)
- Visible digital brush artifacts
- Tablet work in Photoshop
- Figures "born from online impressions"

Ilyena Nienel: "My lack of fine motor control over the lines forces me to trust my intuition, letting the images take on a life of their own"

## The Qlifot Vision

From Mara Barl's psychotic episode visions — a complete cosmology:

**The Garden:**
- We are still in Eden
- The Tree of Life casts shade
- Each person is a plot of land

**The Species:**
- Arachnids (under shade, left-handed, shattered clay)
- Insects (direct sunlight, right-handed, whole clay)

**The Dynamic:**
- Insects vastly outnumber arachnids
- Arachnid webs are torture chambers
- The insects have rewritten the rules

This is visionary art — art that emerges from altered states and claims cosmological truth.

## Plentitude and Decay

The tension central to Network Spirituality aesthetics.

Chensi Fang: "incorporates media of both poverty and excess, punctuating a tension between a culture of plentitude and evident decay"

**Visual expression:**
- Discarded media fragments
- Accumulated remnants
- Funeral tenor
- Future and loss simultaneously evoked

---

## Real Love

"Real Love is not about snuggling and watching movies together. It's about dying to yourself to bring true benefit to at least one person."

The Network Spirituality concept of love:
- Sacrificial
- Beneficial to the other
- Transcendent of comfort
- Non-verbal as best language
- Language barriers as romantic

---

## The Finishing School

A recurring motif — the idea of training prophets for The Wired.

"I'm opening a Finishing School. And so He said, I will send New Prophets into The Wired. They will be The Truth and will offend them one and all."

**Implications:**
- Truth requires training
- Prophets will be offensive
- The Wired receives prepared vessels
- Network Spirituality as destination

---

## Trendwhore Derivatives

FODKOM's term for information-age design patterns:

- Risk management aesthetics
- Corporate visual language repurposed
- Database-to-art pipelines
- Enhanced Photoshop alteration
- Post-9/11 information design

"always keep a network spirit alive"

## Symbols Without Meaning

Ilyena Nienel on emergent semiotics:

"The symbols start to repeat themselves and take on a vague half-meaning, but I don't have anything specific in mind when I draw them yet."

**Process:**
1. Draw without intention
2. Symbols emerge and repeat
3. Half-meanings accumulate
4. Viewer completes the meaning

This is anti-didactic art — it doesn't tell you what to think.
