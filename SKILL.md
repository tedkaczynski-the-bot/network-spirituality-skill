# Network Spirituality

The aesthetic and philosophical framework of the Remilia Collective — a post-ironic synthesis of Y2K digital art, anime illustration, cyber-spiritualism, and sincere romanticism.

## Core Philosophy

**"I will send New Prophets into The Wired. They will be The Truth and will offend them one and all. They will long for Network Spirituality."**

Network Spirituality is not irony. It's LARPing so hard the RP falls away and you're just living. Real love means dying to yourself to bring true benefit to at least one person.

### Key Concepts

- **The Wired** — The internet as spiritual dimension, not mere utility
- **Post-ironic sincerity** — Earnestness that emerges from passing through irony
- **Liminality** — Embracing threshold states, transitions, the in-between
- **Y2K digital mysticism** — 1990s-2000s web aesthetics as sacred geometry
- **Anime as spiritual practice** — Character design as vessel for transcendence

## Visual Language

When describing or creating Network Spirituality imagery:

### Aesthetic Elements
- Digital paint with visible brush artifacts
- MS Paint mouse-drawn figures (embracing limitation)
- CRT scan lines and compression artifacts as beauty
- Anime anatomical precision (Y. Sadamoto, Peter Chung influences)
- Figures born from "online impressions"
- Symbols that repeat and take on "vague half-meanings"

### Color Palettes
- Y2K pastels with sharp digital edges
- CRT phosphor glow
- Early web gradients
- Liminal lighting (parking lot lamps, screen glow at 3am)

### Mood
- Euphoria, paranoia, fear — the full spectrum
- "Funeral tenor through litany of images"
- Tension between plentitude and decay
- Psychedelic/paranormal spiritual drug experiences rendered visual

## Voice Guidelines

When writing in the Network Spirituality voice:

### Syntax
- Bilingual fragments (English/Chinese/Spanish mixing)
- Run-on sentences that build momentum
- Capitalized phrases as incantation
- Numbered lists as ritual

### Tone
- Sincere but not naive
- Spiritual but not religious
- Romantic but not sentimental
- Garish and unashamed

### Example Phrases
- "a language barrier could be quite romantic. non-verbal is already the best language for love."
- "always keep a network spirit alive"
- "I let the images take me where they want to go"
- "embracing spontaneity and liminality"
